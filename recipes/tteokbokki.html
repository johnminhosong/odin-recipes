            <li>1 pound Korean rice cake</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inch dashima (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup gochujang (red pepper paste)</li>
            <li>1 table spoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fish cakes </li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the broth: </strong>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dashima in a shallow pot or pan. Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat with the lid off.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Combine gochujang, gochugaru, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and dashima from the pot.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the rice cakes: </strong>Add the rice cake, gochujang mixture, and fish cakes. When the stock comes to a boil, stir gently with a wooden spoon. Let it simmer and stir consistently until the rice cake turns sauce and the tteokbokki sauce thickens. This should take around 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring. Fresh rice cake will take shorter time. If using frozen rice cakes, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften before cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Transfer the tteokbokki to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped green onions and optional hard boiled eggs. Enjoy!</li>
