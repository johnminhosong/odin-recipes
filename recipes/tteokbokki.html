        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of cylindrical Korean rice cakes</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inch dashima (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup gochujang (red pepper paste)</li>
            <li>1 table spoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fish cakes </li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dashima in a shallow pot or pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat with the lid off.</li>
            <li>Combine gochujang, gochugaru, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and dashima from the pot. Add the rice cake, gochujang mixture, green onion, fish cake, and optional hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2 1/2 cups.</li>
            <li>When the stock comes to a boil, stir gently with a wooden spoon. Let it simmer and stir consistently until the rice cake turns sauce and the tteokbokki sauce thickens. Thi should take around 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring. Fresh rice cake will take shorter time. If using frozen rice cakes, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften before cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve. Enjoy!</li>
